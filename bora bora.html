    <h1>Bora Bora's History</h1>
    <h3>The island's name—the Tahitian spelling of which is Porapora—means 
        “First Born”; according to tradition, it was the first island created after Raiatea. 
        Bora-Bora was sighted by Dutch admiral Jacob Roggeveen in 1722, visited by Capt. James Cook in 1769 and 1777, 
        and annexed by France in the late 19th century.
